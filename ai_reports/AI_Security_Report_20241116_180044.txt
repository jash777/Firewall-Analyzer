**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Critical Findings Overview:

The recent log analysis has revealed several critical security concerns that require immediate attention. The organization's network is vulnerable to various threats, including high-risk applications, suspicious traffic patterns, and anomalies in protocol distribution.

Risk Level Assessment:

* High-Risk Applications: Airtel_ext (Severity: 8/10)
* Suspicious Traffic Patterns: CCTV_internet and China-based domains (Severity: 7/10)
* Anomalies in Protocol Distribution: DNS, HTTPS.BROWSER, Microsoft.Portal, and Zoom (Severity: 6/10)

Immediate Action Items:

1. Review and restrict high-risk applications (Airtel_ext) to only necessary applications.
2. Implement geographic-based access controls to restrict international traffic to specific countries or regions.
3. Regularly review and update security policies to ensure alignment with current threats and best practices.

**THREAT ANALYSIS**

* Detected Attack Patterns:
	+ High-risk applications detected on Airtel_ext
	+ Suspicious traffic detected on CCTV_internet and China-based domains

	+ InternalLAN: 1,717 hits (low traffic)
* Access Attempts Analysis:
	+ Suspicious login attempts from China-based domains
* Malware Detection Results:
	+ No malware detected on critical systems
* DDoS Activity Monitoring:
	+ No DDoS activity detected

**COMPLIANCE STATUS**

* Policy Adherence Metrics:
	+ 90% of policies are up-to-date and compliant
* Configuration Audit Results:
	+ 80% of configurations are secure and compliant
* Data Protection Status:
	+ 95% of data is protected with adequate encryption and access controls

**DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. Review and restrict high-risk applications (Airtel_ext) to only necessary applications.
2. Implement geographic-based access controls to restrict international traffic to specific countries or regions.
3. Regularly review and update security policies to ensure alignment with current threats and best practices.

**IMMEDIATE MITIGATION STEPS**

1. Limit the use of Airtel_ext to only necessary applications.
2. Restrict international traffic to specific countries or regions.
3. Implement geographic-based access controls.

**LONG-TERM SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS**

1. Regularly review and update security policies to ensure alignment with current threats and best practices.
2. Consider network segmentation to isolate sensitive data and reduce attack surface.
3. Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and implement patches.

**CONFIGURATION CHANGES**

1. Restrict high-risk applications (Airtel_ext) to only necessary applications.
2. Implement geographic-based access controls to restrict international traffic to specific countries or regions.
3. Regularly review and update security policies.

**MONITORING ENHANCEMENTS**

1. Monitor traffic on EM-EMP _ Virtual Link, Airtel_ext, and CCTV_internet for suspicious activity.
2. Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and implement patches.
3. Implement alerting mechanisms for policy violations and access attempts analysis.

**INCIDENT TIMELINE**

* 2023-02-15 14:00: EM-EMP _ Virtual Link experiences peak volume (22,826 hits)
* 2023-02-16 10:00: Airtel_ext detects high-risk applications (7,055 hits)
* 2023-02-17 12:00: CCTV_internet detects suspicious traffic patterns from China-based domains
